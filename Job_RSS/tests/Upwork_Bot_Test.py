<![CDATA[
I&#039;m looking for a software engineer who can work with me to scale the prototype/MVP that I built, into a product that can be launched and marketed as a beta. I have used the following technologies to build my MVP:<br /> - Front-end is built using Clojurescript with re-frame ( a Reagent framework for building single page apps in Clojurescript).<br /> - Back-end is built using Clojure.<br /> - The website runs on Jetty with Nginx as the proxy and is hosted on AWS.<br /> - While I&#039;m only focusing on the website, eventually I plan to use ReactNative (via Clojurescript) to build the native mobile apps.<br /><br /> The back-end code for the beta is almost &amp;quot;production ready&amp;quot;. I might have to handle a few performance issues but overall, the code is good. The front-end ClojureScript code is ok as well but the weakest link is the CSS. That&#039;s where I need the most help.<br /><br /> The best candidate for this job will have the following skills:<br /> - Good knowledge of Clojure and ClojureScript. You don&#039;t have to be an expert (I&#039;m not either) but you need to know enough so that I&#039;m not spending all my time teaching you the basics of Clojure and functional programming.<br /> - Very comfortable with front-end technologies like Javascript and CSS.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I don&#039;t have a single line of JS in my code, being comfortable with front-end technologies is critical for this role because I&#039;m looking for someone with complimentary skills. <br /> - Ability to take mocks, assets to build a great user experience. Ability to communicate directly with UX designers would be a huge plus.<br /> - Solid understanding of how to make a responsive website. The website should be ready on Desktop and Mobile web at launch.<br /> - Back-end experience would be nice to have but I&#039;ll mostly be needing your front-end skills. Once the front-end (CSS) code is ready to go, we could collaborate on other areas of the website.<br /> - Experience with React.js would be a huge plus.<br /> - A Github profile with sample code demonstrating how comfortable you are with functional programming would also be a plus.<br /><br /> Other requirements:<br /> - I want to work with individual freelancers. No agencies please. <br /> - Fluent in English and very good written communication skills. Sorry but I don&#039;t want things lost in translation.<br /> - Location doesn&#039;t matter but considering I&#039;m in the US (Pacific), I would prefer candidates in the same time zone.<br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: January 07, 2017 18:20 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Web, Mobile &amp; Software Dev &gt; Web Development<br /><b>Skills</b>: Clojure, CSS, JavaScript, React.js <br /><b>Country</b>: United States<br /><a href="https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Clojurescript-developer-comfortable-with-CSS_%7E01c3015a6b65563be4?source=rss">click to apply</a>
